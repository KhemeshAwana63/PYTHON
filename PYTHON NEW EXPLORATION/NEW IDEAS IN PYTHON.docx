THESE ARE REGARDING FILE INPUT/OUTPUT

1. when we use loops for file ....python can read whole file , or each line , or each character

when python will read the whole file
let's assume we have a file named hub
if "learning" in hub:
    print("yes it exits")              this is reading the whole file

for line in hub:                    this will take one line at a time

for line in hub:
    for char in line:                   this will read each character in each line

2. use of split() and strip() and isdigit()
   a. split()  used to split a string into smaller part by defining the delimeter , default is space " "
     eg .  "hello,world"     -->    it will split each and store them in a list
     extra : make sure that the integers might be stored as string in the list

    b. strip()   used to trim a string both space or if there are empty lines
    c. isdigit()    checks if the string is digit make sure the string is properly trimmed and only has integers





THIS IS TO SHOW THE TIME DIFFERENCE IN A PYTHON LIST AND NUMPY LIST
    import numpy as np
import time

py_list = list(range(100000))
np_array = np.array(py_list)

start_time = time.time()
sum(py_list)
end_time = time.time()
print("the time taken is ",end_time-start_time)

start_time = time.time()
np.sum(np_array)
end_time = time.time()
print("the time taken is ",end_time-start_time)





found = False
for val in list2:
    if 2000 in val:
        print(val[0],"has exactly 2000 rupee expenses")
        found = True
if not found:                                    here i have used the flag method to only print this statement when the 
    print("no month has excatly 2000 rupee expenses")          loop is over
